# CanHacker (lawicel) CAN adapter on Arduino + MCP2515

Use that [Library](https://github.com/autowp/arduino-mcp2515) to communicate with MCP2515

## Features

Implement communication with CAN bus via MCP2515 by CanHacker (lawicel) protocol.

- send & receive can frames
- supports standart (11 bit) & extended (29 bit) frames
- supports remote frames (RTR)
- supports filter by ID (mask + code)
- interface using [Stream](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Stream): ability to work with Serial, SoftwareSerial, Ethernet and other
- supported can baudrates from 10Kbps up to 1Mbps
- supported modules with different oscillators (8, 16, 20 MHz), 16 MHz is default, use setClock if your oscillator is not 16MHz
- support [CanHacker](http://www.mictronics.de/projects/usb-can-bus/) (application for Windows)
- support [CANreader](https://github.com/autowp/CANreader) (application for Android)
